9.	TERMINATION

You can terminate this Agreement by stopping use of all Facepunch Services. We may cancel or suspend (temporarily or permanently) your access to any and/or all of the Facepunch Services if you seriously breach this Agreement.

9.1.	When and how can you terminate this Agreement? You can terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently stopping use of all Facepunch Services. Termination will not affect already existing rights or obligations of us or you.

9.2.	When can we suspend or terminate your access to the Facepunch Services?

If we cancel or suspend your account in this way we will not have any obligations or liabilities to you at all but we will use reasonable efforts to explain why we have done this and what (if anything) you can do as a result.

10.	GOVERNING LAW

Any legal questions / complaints / claims regarding this Agreement are under English law and jurisdiction for users all around the world except users resident in the USA, who are under California law and jurisdiction.

10.1.	If you are resident in the European Union and elsewhere in the world (but not the USA):
You and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of England and any dispute regarding it will be exclusively under the jurisdiction of the courts of England. In any legal claim under this Agreement, the side which wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses. This does not exclude any mandatorily applicable rules or remedies which would be available to you in a legal claim brought under the law of your EU Member State of residence.

10.2.	If you are resident in the USA:
To the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, you and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be deemed to be entered into in San Francisco, California and governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA (and, if applicable, US Federal law) without regard to choice of law principles. Any legal claim by you against Facepunch, to the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, will be made exclusively in state or federal court located in San Francisco, California, which will have subject matter jurisdiction regarding the dispute between you and us and therefore we both consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. Moreover, you waive any rights to argue that the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California are an improper venue. In any legal claim under this Agreement, the side who wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.


11.	DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION

If you have any concerns or issues you can contact us at support@facepunch.com.  We hope we can resolve any complaints with you through informal dispute resolution.

11.1.	Informal dispute resolution:
We and you both agree to make reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve any dispute between us informally - you can contact us at support@facepunch.com. Normally we would suggest that this dispute resolution period lasts 30 days unless exceptional circumstances exist. If it is not resolved during this time, the next steps depend on where you live. If you are resident in the European Union, you may be entitled to submit a complaint through the Online Dispute Resolution Platform operated by the European Commission, details of which can be found at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

If we can't resolve a dispute with you informally, then this is what happens next.

IMPORTANT: if you live in the USA, this section involves both you and us agreeing to mandatory arbitration of any dispute between us. 

11.2.	Dispute resolution next steps: if you live in the European Union or elsewhere in the world (but not the USA): 
You and we have the legal right to commence legal claims against each other if we consider it necessary. If you bring a claim against Facepunch, you should address it to support@facepunch.com.

11.3.	Dispute resolution next steps: if you live in the USA:

(a)	Arbitration: 
We and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration.  This includes without limitation any claims arising from this Agreement, any part of the relationship between you and us or your use of the Facepunch Services or other Facepunch games, products and services.  This section applies whether the dispute or claim is based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation or any other legal doctrine.

(Some explanatory notes from us: "arbitration" is a consensual dispute resolution process where both sides present their case to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury).  Arbitration is less formal than court litigation and it has less formal rules (which we talk about below).  Just so we and you are clear: by choosing arbitration you and we are giving up the right to have any dispute between us heard in court before a judge and/or jury.) You and Facepunch agree that any claim arising out of or related to the Facepunch Services must be made within one (1) year after the claim arose; otherwise, such claim is permanently barred.  You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account or the Facepunch Services.

(b)	How to start an arbitration:
If either of us wants to commence arbitration, then they have to send the other side a written notice setting out the basis of the claim and what remedy the commencing side wants from the other side.  A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  If you send a notice to us, please send by mail and by email.  You or Facepunch may bring an arbitration at any reasonable AAA location within the United States that is convenient for you.  

(c)	The rules for the arbitration:
The US Federal Arbitration Act applies to this section. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by this Agreement (http://www.adr.org). The arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement. 

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators. The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court. The AAA will administer the arbitration and it will be conducted in the English language. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person at a mutually agreed location. The arbitration hearing must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by you and Facepunch.  The AAA will only have power to arbitrate the dispute between you and us and not in relation to other people under this particular arbitration. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.  

If you seek US $10,000 or less, Facepunch agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs (but not including any attorney’s fees or expert witness fees), including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the end of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator decides your claims are without merit or your costs are unreasonable. Facepunch agrees not to seek its legal fees or costs in the arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are without merit or your costs are unreasonable. If you seek more than US $10,000 then the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Facepunch according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if applicable.

(d)	What the dispute resolution and arbitration sections do not apply to:
The dispute resolution and arbitration requirements do not apply to claims or disputes brought by either you or us which relate to claims of intellectual property rights infringement or claims of unauthorised use, piracy, theft or misappropriation.

This section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.

If you live in the USA or the rest of the world (but not the EU), you and we agree not to bring any class action or similar collective legal action against each other.  We will resolve legal disputes with each other through the process outlined above.

11.4.	Waiver of collective action remedies:
To the maximum extent permitted by the national or state law applicable, you and we agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration. That means, to the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. 

If the agreement in this section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration is found illegal or unenforceable, you and Facepunch agree that it will not be severable: this entire section will be deemed unenforceable and any claim or dispute will therefore be resolved in court.


12.	OTHER LEGAL MATTERS

This section sets out a few additional, hopefully self-explanatory rules about how this Agreement works legally. For example, this Agreement is just between you and us, we might be required to comply with law enforcement requests etc.

i.	If any part of this Agreement is found not to be legally enforceable, this will not affect any other part of it;

v.	We can assign, subcontract or transfer this Agreement to a third party or another member of our group if necessary for the support of the Facepunch Services, as part of any reorganisation or merger or for other business reasons. We will notify you if this happens;
vi.	No failure or delay by us or you to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law will constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor will it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy by us or you will preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy; and
vii.	This Agreement does not create any exclusive relationship between us nor any partnership, joint venture, employment or agency.
